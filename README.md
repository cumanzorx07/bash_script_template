<h1>Bash Script Template</h1>

<p>For those who want to start in the world of bash scripting, I took the liberty to start a new project in github, this is a starter bash script, that provides some basic functions and techniques just to free you from the hard step of setting up everything.</p>
<p>With this script, you have:</p>
<ul>
<li>A copyright section (not really useful, but it may come in handy)</li>
<li>Sections for global variables , common methods and argument parsing (a place for everything and everything in its place)</li>
<li>A great argument parsing, based on http://kirk.webfinish.com/?p=45</li>
<li>Methods for checking if the user is root or wait for background procedures to finish</li>
<li>More functions will be added eventuallyâ€¦.</li>
</ul>
